#Assume you have the assignment xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20] - Name your files 5a.py, 5b.py, etc..
#Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
#Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.
#Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called total. You should set the total variable to have the value 0 before you start adding them up, and print the value in total after the loop has completed.
#Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)
